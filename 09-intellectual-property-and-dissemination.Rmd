# **Intellectual Property and Dissemination**

## Intellectual Property

[THIS NEEDS DISCUSSION! THIS IS THE MOST RESTRICTIVE VERSION - CC BY 4.0 IS MORE IN LINE WITH MAXIMUM OPENNESS]

As an open, community-driven initiative, FORRT is committed to the principles of open knowledge sharing. Unless otherwise stated, all content developed under FORRT projects is made openly available under a Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).

This means:
- Anyone can use, adapt, and redistribute FORRT materials non-commercially.
- Derivative works must credit the original creators and be shared under the same license.
- Commercial use requires explicit permission from the original creators.

## Contributor Rights

Contributors retain copyright to their individual contributions. By participating in a FORRT project, contributors agree to:
- Share their work under an open license
- Be credited appropriately in outputs (see section on authorship and attribution below)
- Allow FORRT to disseminate and adapt the work in line with its mission

In case of collaborative or multi-authored work, the team lead(s) coordinate final authorship and licensing decisions in alignment with community norms and with support from the Steering Council, if needed.

## Licensing for Code and Tools

FORRT projects involving code (e.g., data tools, websites, automation scripts) should use an Open Source Initiative–approved license such as:
- MIT License
- GNU GPL v3
- Apache License 2.0

Each GitHub repository should include a `LICENSE` file and a README describing how the tool or codebase is meant to be used and cited.

## Dissemination Strategy

Dissemination in FORRT is guided by our goals of openness, visibility, accessibility, and collaboration. We prioritize making all outputs easy to find, share, and reuse.

### Main Dissemination Channels
- **FORRT Website** — [INSERT LINK] — the primary hub for public materials
- **OSF** — for archiving, versioning, and licensing teaching materials, tools, and reports
- **GitHub** — for collaboratively maintained resources, code, and lesson plans
- **Social Media** — coordinated by the Outreach Team (e.g., Twitter, Mastodon, LinkedIn)
- **Newsletter** — shared regularly to FORRT subscribers highlighting news, outputs, and community updates
- **Workshops and Events** — including conference presentations, webinars, and co-organized trainings

### Supporting Teams
- **Team Outreach** — coordinates dissemination across platforms
- **Team Website** — helps publish content and manage web presence
- **Team Impact / Team Pedagogies** — contribute to public engagement via papers, materials, and events

[OPEN QUESTION: Should we develop a dissemination planning checklist for project leads (e.g., “Have you submitted to OSF? Tweeted it? Added a summary to the website?”)?]

## Publication and Attribution Guidelines

When preparing written outputs (e.g., preprints, reports, guides), FORRT encourages teams to:
- Use the **CRediT taxonomy** to describe contributor roles
- Share drafts internally for feedback and transparency
- Publish under open-access models whenever possible
- Include a DOI, open license, and link to any supporting materials

FORRT recognizes all forms of contribution (technical, editorial, design, writing, leadership) and encourages equitable practices in authorship and visibility.

## Metrics and Engagement

We encourage teams to track and reflect on engagement with their outputs. This may include:
- OSF or GitHub download and fork counts
- Website page views
- Social media analytics (via Outreach Team)
- Feedback collected from users or workshop participants

These metrics are useful not only for reporting and improving future outputs, but also for recognizing contributors’ impact.

[OPEN QUESTION: Should we build a lightweight “impact tracker” spreadsheet or dashboard across teams?]

All FORRT outputs are part of our broader mission to foster principled, inclusive, and community-driven open education. Our dissemination and licensing practices aim to reflect those values while providing contributors with recognition and users with flexibility.
