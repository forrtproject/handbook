# **Overview of Key Dates**

FORRT’s decentralized and volunteer-based structure benefits from having a shared overview of important dates, deadlines, and milestones. While projects are generally not bound by external funders, coordinating timelines helps us support one another and maintain momentum across initiatives.

## Community Calendar

A shared **Community Calendar** is maintained to provide visibility into:
- Major project deliverable deadlines
- Community-wide events (e.g., workshops, hackathons, onboarding calls)
- Leadership and Steering Council meetings
- Proposal submission dates for grants or partnerships
- External events relevant to FORRT's mission

### Who Updates It?

- **Team Leads** are encouraged to add relevant internal and external deadlines for their team’s initiatives.
- The **Operations Coordinator** (or equivalent) supports calendar maintenance and ensures recurring meetings are visible.

## Planning Key Dates

Although projects may operate at different paces, all teams are encouraged to:
- Set internal timelines for major outputs at project kickoff
- Share target milestones with the wider FORRT community via Slack (#project-updates)
- Revisit and update plans quarterly or after major deliverables

To support this, FORRT offers a simple [Timeline Planning Template – INSERT LINK] that teams can adapt for their needs.

### Example Milestone Types

| Milestone Type           | Example                                              |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Project launch           | Kickoff of a new team or initiative                  |
| Draft completion         | Initial draft of lesson plans, tool, or article      |
| Internal review window   | Period for peer review and revisions                 |
| Public release           | OSF/GitHub upload, website announcement              |
| Outreach event           | Webinar, workshop, or community showcase             |
| Strategic decision point | Steering Council discussion of next-phase goals     |

## Coordination Across Teams

Because some contributors are involved in multiple initiatives, project leads should coordinate:
- Around high-demand periods (e.g., conference deadlines, holidays)
- Before cross-cutting meetings or public launches
- When seeking reviewers or design support across teams

We encourage teams to signal important dates early in Slack or in the calendar to help others plan capacity.

## Quarterly Planning

Each quarter, the Steering Council and team leads may collectively review:
- What's launching
- What’s wrapping up
- What teams need help with
- Opportunities for collaboration or showcasing work

This supports strategic alignment without overburdening contributors.
