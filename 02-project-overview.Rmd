# **Project Overview**

FORRT is a grassroots, community-led initiative focused on integrating open and reproducible scholarship into higher education. It consists of a diverse network of educators, researchers, students, and practitioners from around the globe who contribute voluntarily to FORRT’s mission. The initiative is coordinated through an informal yet organized structure of teams, each working on specific projects or thematic areas aligned with FORRT’s goals.

While FORRT has begun employing a small number of freelancers for specific tasks, the overwhelming majority of our work is performed by volunteers who contribute as time and capacity allow. This unique structure enables a high degree of flexibility, creativity, and inclusion, though it also places a premium on careful communication, transparent planning, and respectful coordination of expectations and commitments.

FORRT operates as a distributed organization under the umbrella of FORRT e.V., a nonprofit association registered in Germany. This legal entity can support fundraising and contracting when necessary, but most day-to-day activities take place in teams coordinated via Slack, shared documents, and collaborative project tools.

## Key Areas of Activity

### Curriculum Hub

The **Curriculum Hub** aims to empower educators and learners worldwide to engage with, understand, and implement Open Science principles and practices. It includes:

- Thematic clusters covering key areas of open and reproducible research
- Glossary entries with clear and accessible definitions
- Curated resources for educators and learners
- Summaries of key readings
- Pedagogical and didactic lesson plans
- Slide decks with lecture notes
- Example syllabi and course materials
- Gamified learning tools and activities

These outputs are created and maintained collaboratively by FORRT volunteers and are openly licensed to allow reuse and adaptation. The work is organized through relevant FORRT teams (e.g., Team Glossary, Team Lesson Plans, Team Summaries, Team Pedagogies, Team Website).

### Replication Hub

The **Replication Hub** promotes reproducible science by supporting high-quality replication and reproduction projects. It includes:

- Annual Replication Workshops
- Mentorship for first-time replicators
- Open manuscript templates (StaRT) and featured reports
- Collaboration with the Institute for Replication and replication journal alliances
- A semi-automated replication database (FReD)
- A Replication Impact Dashboard
- A community-driven collection of replication reversals
- Educational plug-ins and tools for use in courses

This initiative is coordinated with international partners and is designed to serve both as a community of practice and a resource repository.

## Types of Contributions

Contributors to FORRT engage in a wide variety of activities, including:

- Developing and curating educational resources
- Leading or supporting specific teams or projects
- Reviewing and editing documents and lesson plans
- Creating visual or technical assets (e.g., slide decks, websites)
- Organizing events and outreach efforts
- Mentoring others or receiving mentorship
- Sharing feedback and helping improve processes

As a volunteer initiative, FORRT recognizes that capacity varies widely. Contributors are encouraged to be transparent about their availability and to engage at levels that are sustainable for them.

## Modes of Support

Although most of FORRT's work is volunteer-led, we occasionally support contributors financially through:

- Freelance contracts for specific technical or editorial tasks
- Stipends for work packages where funding is secured (e.g., through grants)
- Institutional partnerships that fund in-kind or financial contributions

Paid and volunteer work are both essential to FORRT's functioning. Our internal policies promote transparency and fairness in allocating any paid roles, while safeguarding the community ethos that underpins the initiative.

## Strategic Priorities

FORRT’s medium-term priorities include:

- Professionalizing internal project management while remaining flexible and community-centered
- Securing funding to ensure sustainability and equitable participation
- Expanding global inclusion by translating materials and adapting them to varied contexts
- Increasing institutional recognition of open and reproducible scholarship in teaching

These priorities are advanced through active collaboration between FORRT teams and guided by the Steering Council and the wider community.
