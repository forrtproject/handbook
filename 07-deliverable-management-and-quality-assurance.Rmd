# **Deliverable Management and Quality Assurance**

FORRT’s outputs—ranging from pedagogical materials to meta-scientific reports—are created by decentralized teams of volunteers and collaborators. To maintain consistency and credibility, this chapter outlines a shared approach for managing deliverables and ensuring quality across teams and projects.

## What Counts as a Deliverable?

A "deliverable" is any finalized, shareable output of a FORRT project, such as:
- Lesson plans, glossaries, summaries, and syllabi
- Educational slide decks and speaker notes
- Reports, position papers, and preprints
- Tools, guides, or templates developed for educators or researchers
- Visuals, outreach assets, or digital tools

Deliverables may be made publicly available on the FORRT website, OSF, GitHub, Zenodo, or partner platforms.

## Deliverable Lifecycle

| Stage            | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Drafting         | Teams develop content collaboratively using shared docs or GitHub repos.   |
| Internal Review  | Peers from within or beyond the team give feedback and suggest revisions.   |
| Finalization     | The team incorporates feedback, polishes structure and formatting.          |
| Publication      | Deliverables are made publicly available with proper licenses and metadata. |
| Promotion        | The Outreach team supports dissemination and visibility.                    |

## Document Structure and Templates

To ensure consistency, FORRT encourages teams to follow this general deliverable structure:

1. **Title Page** (including project name, contributors, date, and version)
2. **Table of Contents** (for documents longer than 5 pages)
3. **Executive Summary** (optional, recommended for lengthy reports)
4. **Main Content** (structured in clear, numbered sections)
5. **Acknowledgments** (including contributors and reviewers)
6. **References** (formatted consistently)
7. **Appendices** (if needed)
8. **Licensing Info** (e.g., CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)

A shared [Deliverable Template – LINK TO TEMPLATE] is available and can be adapted per project needs.

## Internal Review Process

FORRT encourages a light, transparent, and supportive review process before any major deliverable is released:

- **Step 1: Peer Review**
  - At least one team member not involved in the core drafting process reviews the document.
  - Larger deliverables (e.g., reports) may benefit from two reviewers.

- **Step 2: Revisions**
  - Authors incorporate feedback and notify reviewers when finalized.

- **Step 3: Optional Community Feedback**
  - For larger strategic documents, team leads may invite feedback from other teams or the Steering Council.

- **Step 4: Public Release**
  - Deliverables are published to OSF, GitHub, or the FORRT website as appropriate.

## Style and Formatting

- Use inclusive, accessible language.
- Avoid jargon where possible or define key terms clearly.
- Check spelling and grammar.
- Use consistent headings and formatting.
- Provide alt-text for images/diagrams when applicable.

## Licensing and Attribution

All deliverables should:
- Be openly licensed (e.g., CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 unless otherwise agreed)
- List all contributors clearly (using CRediT roles if relevant)
- Link to source files and relevant FORRT teams

## Archiving and Access

Final versions of deliverables should be:
- Stored in the relevant shared team folder (Google Drive or OSF)
- Archived publicly (OSF or Zenodo preferred)
- Added to any central deliverable list or project overview page

[OPEN QUESTION: Who is responsible for maintaining a central archive index? Should this fall under the Operations Coordinator or be team-specific?]

This shared process is not meant to be a burden—it’s a scaffold to help FORRT contributors create sustainable, reusable, and professional outputs together.
