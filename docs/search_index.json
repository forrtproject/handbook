Our mission is to empower educators and learners worldwide by integrating open and reproducible practices into research training. Through community‐driven pedagogical reform, we aim to advance research transparency, reproducibility, rigor, and ethics in a manner that is accessible and equitable to all. [INSERT FORRT LOGO/BRANDING AS NEEDED] 2.2 Background In recent years, the importance of open and reproducible practices in research has become increasingly clear. While many initiatives focus on research integrity, far fewer address the essential role of education in embedding these practices into daily academic work. FORRT was established as a grassroots, volunteer‐driven community dedicated to transforming science education by integrating open scholarship into teaching and mentoring. Our approach emphasizes practical engagement, collaborative resource development, and the promotion of scholarly openness as a social justice imperative. Note: This handbook was developed in response to the evolving landscape of open science education and is designed to serve both internal project leads and external collaborators. It is built on the iRise project management handbook, for which we are very grateful. 2.3 Objectives The primary objectives of FORRT are to: Develop a Shared Framework: Establish clear definitions and guidelines for integrating open science practices into educational settings. Curate High-Quality Resources: Assemble and evaluate pedagogical tools (e.g., lesson plans, summaries, glossaries) that support open and reproducible research training. Embed Diversity and Inclusivity: Ensure that our initiatives actively promote equity and provide opportunities for underrepresented groups. Engage the Community: Involve educators, students, and stakeholders in a collaborative process to co-create and continuously refine our tools and practices. Pilot and Implement Initiatives: Launch programs such as mentorship schemes, open office hours, and collaborative workshops that demonstrate the practical benefits of open scholarship. Disseminate Openly: Share our resources and outcomes through open-access platforms and strategic partnerships to contribute to the global conversation on open science. 2.4 Project Management Philosophy Effective project management in FORRT is not defined by strict timelines or budgets alone—it is the cohesive force that unites our community and ensures that our collective efforts remain aligned with our mission. Our approach prioritizes flexibility, proactive communication, and continuous improvement. By fostering an environment where ideas are freely shared and every contribution is recognized, we empower volunteers to bring their unique strengths to our projects. 2.5 Terminology and Audience In this handbook, traditional consortium terminology has been replaced with language that reflects our community-driven model. All team members—whether internal project leads or external collaborators—are integral parts of the FORRT community. This document is designed to guide everyone in managing projects efficiently while upholding FORRT’s core values. 2.6 Handbook Purpose This handbook is a living document that provides practical guidance on managing FORRT projects. It outlines procedures, best practices, and strategic approaches to ensure that all initiatives remain aligned with our mission and values. The handbook serves as a resource for: Internal Project Leads: To streamline planning, coordination, and quality assurance across our diverse teams. External Collaborators: To understand our approach, engage effectively with our community, and contribute to our shared objectives.

[INSERT ADDITIONAL CONTACTS OR LINKS AS REQUIRED - BUT NO NEED TO REPEAT THE TOC] "],["project-overview.html", "3 Project Overview 3.1 Key Areas of Activity 3.2 Types of Contributions 3.3 Modes of Support 3.4 Strategic Priorities", " 3 Project Overview FORRT is a grassroots, community-led initiative focused on integrating open and reproducible scholarship into higher education. It consists of a diverse network of educators, researchers, students, and practitioners from around the globe who contribute voluntarily to FORRT’s mission. The initiative is coordinated through an informal yet organized structure of teams, each working on specific projects or thematic areas aligned with FORRT’s goals. While FORRT has begun employing a small number of freelancers for specific tasks, the overwhelming majority of our work is performed by volunteers who contribute as time and capacity allow. This unique structure enables a high degree of flexibility, creativity, and inclusion, though it also places a premium on careful communication, transparent planning, and respectful coordination of expectations and commitments. FORRT operates as a distributed organization under the umbrella of FORRT e.V., a nonprofit association registered in Germany. This legal entity can support fundraising and contracting when necessary, but most day-to-day activities take place in teams coordinated via Slack, shared documents, and collaborative project tools. 3.1 Key Areas of Activity 3.1.1 Curriculum Hub The Curriculum Hub aims to empower educators and learners worldwide to engage with, understand, and implement Open Science principles and practices. It includes: Thematic clusters covering key areas of open and reproducible research Glossary entries with clear and accessible definitions Curated resources for educators and learners Summaries of key readings Pedagogical and didactic lesson plans Slide decks with lecture notes Example syllabi and course materials Gamified learning tools and activities These outputs are created and maintained collaboratively by FORRT volunteers and are openly licensed to allow reuse and adaptation. The work is organized through relevant FORRT teams (e.g., Team Glossary, Team Lesson Plans, Team Summaries, Team Pedagogies, Team Website). 3.1.2 Replication Hub The Replication Hub promotes reproducible science by supporting high-quality replication and reproduction projects. It includes: Annual Replication Workshops Mentorship for first-time replicators Open manuscript templates (StaRT) and featured reports Collaboration with the Institute for Replication and replication journal alliances A semi-automated replication database (FReD) A Replication Impact Dashboard A community-driven collection of replication reversals Educational plug-ins and tools for use in courses This initiative is coordinated with international partners and is designed to serve both as a community of practice and a resource repository. 3.2 Types of Contributions Contributors to FORRT engage in a wide variety of activities, including: Developing and curating educational resources Leading or supporting specific teams or projects Reviewing and editing documents and lesson plans Creating visual or technical assets (e.g., slide decks, websites) Organizing events and outreach efforts Mentoring others or receiving mentorship Sharing feedback and helping improve processes As a volunteer initiative, FORRT recognizes that capacity varies widely. Contributors are encouraged to be transparent about their availability and to engage at levels that are sustainable for them. 3.3 Modes of Support Although most of FORRT’s work is volunteer-led, we occasionally support contributors financially through: Freelance contracts for specific technical or editorial tasks Stipends for work packages where funding is secured (e.g., through grants) Institutional partnerships that fund in-kind or financial contributions Paid and volunteer work are both essential to FORRT’s functioning. Our internal policies promote transparency and fairness in allocating any paid roles, while safeguarding the community ethos that underpins the initiative. 3.4 Strategic Priorities FORRT’s medium-term priorities include: Professionalizing internal project management while remaining flexible and community-centered Securing funding to ensure sustainability and equitable participation Expanding global inclusion by translating materials and adapting them to varied contexts Increasing institutional recognition of open and reproducible scholarship in teaching These priorities are advanced through active collaboration between FORRT teams and guided by the Steering Council and the wider community.

While we are not a formal consortium, our community includes a broad range of contributors and collaborators who work together toward shared goals. Our governance approach is built around openness, inclusivity, and decentralized coordination, allowing for both flexibility and accountability. 4.1 Core Coordination Team FORRT’s overall direction and coordination are supported by a core group of volunteer leaders, including founding members and elected coordinators. These individuals help maintain the coherence of FORRT’s vision, align projects with strategic goals, and serve as stewards of FORRT’s values. The core coordination team is responsible for: - Facilitating cross-team communication - Setting internal timelines and shared priorities - Supporting project leads in resolving challenges - Representing FORRT in external collaborations and partnerships [INSERT CURRENT LIST OF CORE COORDINATORS AND THEIR ROLES] 4.2 Steering Council The Steering Council includes: - Core coordinators - Leads from each active team or initiative - [Optional: rotating community representatives or advisory board members?] It provides strategic oversight, reviews ongoing work, and offers guidance to project leads. The Steering Council meets at least quarterly and plays a central role in identifying priorities, aligning new initiatives with FORRT’s mission, and mediating any disputes. [OPEN QUESTION: Should we define fixed terms or a rotating structure for Steering Council membership?] 4.3 Project and Team Leads FORRT’s day-to-day work is organized through teams that focus on specific areas (e.g., Team Ethics, Team Glossary, Team Lesson Plans). Each team typically has one or more Team Leads who: - Facilitate planning and internal communication - Coordinate contributions from volunteers - Represent the team in Steering Council discussions - Track progress and update relevant documentation Team leads may emerge organically or be selected through consensus. We aim to avoid gatekeeping and encourage distributed responsibility while ensuring that someone is accountable for keeping momentum and supporting contributors. [INSERT LINK TO CURRENT TEAM OVERVIEW DOCUMENT] 4.4 Operations and Project Management Because FORRT relies heavily on volunteer labor, we balance structure with flexibility. Rather than a central Project Management Office, operations support is provided by designated roles such as: - Operations Coordinator or Team Cohesion lead - [Optional: Admin support or paid freelance project managers for funded work] Responsibilities may include: - Maintaining shared documentation and templates - Supporting onboarding of new project leads - Overseeing deliverable timelines and shared calendars - Helping coordinate inter-team collaboration [OPEN QUESTION: What roles or tools would help us maintain cohesion across teams without centralizing authority? Should we invest in shared onboarding or PM toolkits for new project leads?] 4.5 Freelancers and Paid Support While FORRT is primarily volunteer-driven, we sometimes employ freelancers for specific tasks (e.g., development, editing, accessibility audits). These contributors are typically brought on through transparent, needs-based decisions by the core coordination team or relevant team leads. We strive to: - Maintain parity and transparency between paid and unpaid contributions - Clearly communicate expectations and deliverables - Recognize all forms of contribution equally [INSERT LINK TO CURRENT POLICY OR DRAFT ON PAID ENGAGEMENTS IF AVAILABLE] 4.6 External Collaborators External contributors (e.g., co-authors, advisors, partner organizations) are welcomed into FORRT projects through informal or formal collaboration agreements, depending on the scope. Project leads are responsible for: - Clarifying expectations and timelines - Ensuring collaborators align with FORRT’s values - Managing any authorship or data-sharing concerns upfront [OPEN QUESTION: Should we develop a lightweight collaboration MoU or checklist for external contributors?] 4.7 Governance Values Our governance structure is guided by: - Transparency: All decisions, changes, and updates should be shared openly within relevant Slack channels or documents. - Flexibility: Volunteers engage at levels that match their capacity, and roles evolve over time. - Inclusion: All members are encouraged to lead, suggest changes, and contribute meaningfully to FORRT’s direction. [INSERT LINK TO CODE OF CONDUCT AND VALUES STATEMENT] 4.8 Decision-Making Major decisions (e.g., starting or sunsetting a project, adopting new policies) are made via consensus in the Steering Council or community-wide consultation. Smaller, team-level decisions are made by team leads in coordination with active members.

This chapter outlines how internal and external communication should be structured to promote transparency, responsiveness, and shared ownership. 5.1 Internal Communication 5.1.1 Slack Slack is FORRT’s primary platform for internal communication. Every contributor is expected to join our Slack workspace and participate in the appropriate team channels (e.g., #team-glossary, #team-lesson-plans). Best Practices: - Use public channels for most project discussions to ensure transparency and allow others to learn or contribute. - Threads should be used for replies to keep conversations organized. - Use channel-specific tags or emojis to signal updates or tasks. - Pin important documents or decisions to the channel for easy reference. New members receive an invite during onboarding. [INSERT LINK OR CONTACT FOR SLACK INVITE] [OPEN QUESTION: Should we develop lightweight Slack etiquette or onboarding guide for new contributors?] 5.1.2 Email Email may still be used for more formal communication (e.g., external collaborators, contracts, or institutional outreach). FORRT does not use internal mailing lists. If email is necessary, use clear subject lines (e.g., “FORRT – [Team/Project]: Topic”) and include relevant Slack or document links. [OPEN QUESTION: Should core FORRT coordinators use a shared inbox or alias for external outreach?] 5.1.3 Shared Documents Project documents, meeting notes, and deliverables are stored in cloud-based platforms (typically Google Drive or OSF). Each team is responsible for maintaining its folder and updating links in relevant Slack channels or documents. Best Practices: - Name documents and folders clearly (e.g., “Glossary_Draft_v1_2025-03-01”). - Use shared drives where possible instead of personal storage. - Avoid duplicate versions; link directly to editable files in Slack or documentation. [INSERT LINK TO SHARED FILE DIRECTORY OR TEAM FOLDER INDEX] 5.2 Meetings 5.2.1 Team Meetings Each team is encouraged to meet at least monthly to: - Review progress on ongoing tasks - Assign roles and support contributors - Identify blockers and request help if needed Meeting notes should be stored in a shared team folder and shared (or summarized) in the relevant Slack channel. A template for meeting notes is available here: [INSERT LINK TO TEMPLATE] 5.2.2 Leadership and Steering Council Meetings The FORRT Steering Council meets quarterly to: - Review ongoing work across teams - Discuss cross-team coordination - Set shared priorities and timelines - Review feedback and potential structural improvements Team leads may be asked to submit brief updates ahead of these meetings. [OPEN QUESTION: Should we formalize a rotating chair or note-taker role for Steering Council meetings?] 5.2.3 Community-Wide Events Occasional community-wide events (e.g., onboarding calls, open idea workshops, open office hours) are coordinated by the Operations Coordinator or relevant project leads and announced via Slack. 5.3 External Communication External communication is aligned with FORRT’s values of openness, accuracy, inclusivity, and clarity. 5.3.1 Public Announcements All public-facing content (e.g., project launches, calls for participation, published outputs) should: - Use consistent branding and naming conventions - Credit contributors appropriately - Include links to source documents and licenses (e.g., CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) External announcements are usually coordinated by the Outreach Team or project-specific leads. Shared templates and logos can be found here: [INSERT LINK TO BRANDING KIT] [OPEN QUESTION: Should project leads use a short approval checklist for public comms, especially if involving new partners?] 5.3.2 Social Media and Outreach FORRT uses social media (e.g., Twitter, Mastodon, LinkedIn) to: - Share new outputs and events - Amplify related work from partners and contributors - Showcase community highlights The Outreach Team manages main accounts. Team leads may coordinate with them for joint announcements or event promotion. 5.4 Reporting 5.4.1 Project Updates Each team or project is expected to provide periodic updates in the #project-updates Slack channel. This helps the broader community stay informed and allows cross-pollination of ideas. Recommended frequency: once every 4–6 weeks or before major milestones. 5.4.2 Leadership Updates Before each Steering Council meeting, team leads are asked to submit a short written update, including: - Progress highlights - Any blockers or support needs - Planned next steps - New contributors or changes in leadership A shared template is available to streamline these updates. [INSERT LINK TO TEMPLATE] 5.4.3 Transparency and Accountability All major decisions, deliverables, and documents should be documented in shared team folders or publicly accessible repositories when appropriate. FORRT emphasizes constructive feedback, openness to iteration, and shared ownership of outcomes. 5.5 Summary Communication Type Platform / Format Who is Responsible Frequency Day-to-day chat Slack channels All team members Continuous File sharing Google Drive / OSF Team leads Continuous Team meetings Zoom or Google Meet Team leads Monthly Leadership meetings Zoom / Shared doc updates Steering Council Quarterly Project updates Slack #project-updates Project leads Monthly (recommended) External outreach Social media / newsletter Outreach Team + Leads As needed [INSERT LINKS TO SHARED RESOURCES, MEETING TEMPLATES, AND COMMS TOOLKIT] "],["data-and-file-management.html", "6 Data and File Management 6.1 File Storage and Collaboration 6.2 Naming and Version Control 6.3 Data Management for Projects 6.4 Open Access and Licensing 6.5 Backups and Archiving 6.6 Summary 6.7 iRise Minimal metadata standards", " 6 Data and File Management FORRT relies on open, accessible, and well-organized data and documentation to support collaboration across its distributed, volunteer-based teams. This chapter outlines best practices for managing files, documentation, and any data generated through FORRT projects. 6.1 File Storage and Collaboration All files should be stored in centralized, team-specific folders using approved cloud-based services. Commonly used platforms include: - Google Drive (for editable documents, slides, planning spreadsheets) - OSF (for archival storage, public access, and preprints) - GitHub (for websites, lesson plans, or code) 6.1.1 Principles Use shared team folders, not personal accounts. Share links instead of downloading/uploading versions to avoid version conflicts. Name files and folders clearly (e.g., “FORRT_ReplicationHub_WorkshopPlanning_2025-04”). Keep public and private files clearly separated and labeled.

Templates for file names and folders are available here: [INSERT LINK TO NAMING GUIDELINES OR TEMPLATE] 6.3 Data Management for Projects Most FORRT work is educational or resource-based and does not involve sensitive data. However, when data is collected (e.g., through surveys, interviews, analytics), teams must ensure ethical handling and documentation. 6.3.1 What to Consider What data is being collected (e.g., feedback, demographic info)? How will it be stored securely? Who has access? Will it be shared, published, or deleted? A simple Data Management Plan (DMP) template is available and should be used for any project involving participant or user data. [INSERT LINK TO DMP TEMPLATE] 6.3.2 Roles and Responsibilities Team/project leads are responsible for coordinating data handling practices. If unsure, consult Team Ethics or the Steering Council for guidance. [OPEN QUESTION: Should we create a central log or register of ongoing data-collecting projects across FORRT?] 6.4 Open Access and Licensing All final outputs (documents, slides, lesson plans, tools) should be: - Shared publicly via OSF, GitHub, or the FORRT website - Accompanied by a clear usage license (typically CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) Where possible, include: - A README file explaining what the resource is, how it was created, and how to use it - Metadata (title, creators, keywords, version, date, link to related projects) For code and software, use an OSI-approved open source license (e.g., MIT, GPL) and host on GitHub or similar.

All data outputs will be complemented with metadata, as outlined in the DMP. The following elements are required: Title: title describing the data output at hand. Principal Investigator or Creator: the main person(s) responsible for the intellectual content, with affiliation(s). Contributor(s): any other person(s) who contributed to the data output with affiliation(s). Funding: funding source of the project leading to the data output (iRISE and additional funding sources must be acknowledged here). References and citations: Citations to relevant work or other objects/material leading to the data output or using the data output. Only cite those articles or material that are important for the data output to be reusable and interpretable. Specifically, if applicable, cite any software or material needed to interact with the data. Summary | Description: A textual description of the aims of data collection and a summary of the data output itself (in the form of a short abstract). Keywords: List of relevant keywords making the metadata findable. Coverage: when and where was the data collection - or the project - started and when was it finalized. Date of publication: Date of data deposition (first – and new versions) Unit of observation Population: information on the population of interest represented or targeted in the data output. Data type and format: information on the type and format of the data collected. Sampling and weighting: information on whether any sampling or weighting was used in the data acquisition, and if so, which type or method of sampling and/or weighting was used. Mode of Collection: information on how the data was collected, on the method used for data collection. DOI Licenses and restrictions Ethical considerations: if ethical approval was needed and acquired, the metadata should link or cite the ethics approval. Description of variables: if possible, this should be done in a separate code book or data dictionary.

They cover the following project periods: Period 1: M1-M18 = 1 September 2023 – 28 February 2025 Period 2: M19-M36 = 1 March 2025 – 28 August 2026 The periodic reports will be submitted by the coordinator within 60 days of the end of each reporting period, which is in M18 and M36 respectively. General reporting principles will be as follows: The Project Coordinator will request WP leaders to report on their WP using a generic reporting template provided by the Project Coordinator; WP leaders will prepare inputs for the periodic report by collecting inputs from their WP task leaders; The Project Coordinator will combine all this information into a coherent periodic report. All partners will then review this report. The Project Coordinator will then revise appropriately and submit to the EC by the required date. Please note that all partners must keep time records of the hours worked on the action, in accordance with Article 20.1(e) of the Grant Agreement. 7.1 Periodic Technical Reporting The periodic technical reports cover the work conducted by the project partners between M1 and M18, and M19 and M36. The periodic reports will follow the official template and will contain the following parts: Part A: Is created by the participant portal’s IT system based on information entered by participants. Summary for publication Summary of the context and overall objectives of the project Work performed from the beginning of the project to the end of the period covered by the report including main results achieved so far Progress beyond the state of the art and expected potential impact Overview of researchers involved in the project Deliverables Milestones Critical Risks Project Pathway to Impact Results Ownership List Publications Datasets Intellectual property rights Standards Other results Dissemination and communication activities Impact Research Infrastructure Part B: Part B will be compiled in a Word document within the Teams environment, based on inputs provided by the WP leads and then submitted as one comprehensive report by the coordinator. Explanation of the work carried out by the beneficiaries and overview of the progress Objectives of the project Explanation of the work carried out in each WP Impact Follow-up of recommendations and comments from previous review(s) (if applicable) Open Science Deviations from Description of Action (Annex 1 &amp; 2) (if applicable) 7.2 Periodic Financial Reporting Financial statements cover each partner’s cost claim for the previous reporting period. They will be submitted to the European Commission electronically via the participant portal. An individual financial statement (Annex 4 of the GA) from each beneficiary will provide an explanation of the use of resources and the information on subcontracting and in-kind contributions provided by third parties from each beneficiary for the reporting period concerned. Before submission, the financial statement must be signed by the financial signatory at each partner institution (FSIGN). The request for interim payment will be also submitted together with the financial statement. If a partner does not submit their financial reporting on time, no interim payment to the respective partner will be made during this period. The individual financial statement must detail the eligible costs (outlined under Article 6 of the GA) for each budget category (see Annex 2). Eligible costs include: direct personnel costs; direct costs of subcontracting; direct costs of providing financial support to third parties; other direct costs (travel costs, equipment, other goods and services); indirect costs (flat rate 25%) All records and supporting documents of costs must be kept as proofs (see article 20 of the GA). Further information related to financial management can be found in the EC Online Manual. To ensure smooth and accurate financial reporting, iRISE will undertake a “dry run” of the financial reporting exercise in Month 6 – February 2024. 7.3 Continuous Reporting Continuous Reporting is available from the beginning of the project and can be edited by all beneficiaries in SyGMa (System for Grant Management). A snapshot of the data entered within the tabs for continuous reporting will also be included in the periodic reports when submitted. More information on continuous reporting can be found here. 7.3.1 Reporting on Impact Different SyGMa tabs (Impact, Impact continuation, Beneficiaries feedback) include questionnaires to monitor and evaluate the Horizon Europe programme performance. There, progress of the impact is recorded. Impact questionnaire: collects information about technology readiness, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and citizen engagement Impact continuation questionnaire: records information about scientific, societal, environmental and economic impacts of project implementation Beneficiaries feedback questionnaire asks about key factors fostering and impeding the impact of the progress of the project 7.3.2 Reporting on Communication, Dissemination and Exploitation Reporting on communication, dissemination and exploitation follows a qualitative rather than a quantitative approach. Two separate tabs exist in SyGMa on communication and dissemination activities. The main communication and dissemination activities should be added to these tabs, especially when costs were charged to the project. Activities should be described including their purpose, the target audience and their status. It is critical the iRISE consortium members regularly enter details into the Dissemination Activity Record to facilitate this reporting. Entries can be removed from SyGMa if they have not been included in a periodic report and edited if they have not been included in an intermediate report. The final periodic report must include at least one communication and one dissemination activity with the status “delivered” and no activities with the stats “ongoing” or “postponed”. 7.3.3 Reporting on Project Results Continuous reporting on project results is also required, focusing on content. The according tabs in SyGMa are called “Results” and “Other Results”. Name and type of results is to be recorded, if they are Key Exploitable Results, audience or target groups and steps undertaken towards exploitation and market maturity. 7.3.4 Project Summary The project summary is automatically published in CORDIS with the proposal abstract already filled in. It should be continuously updated when the project produces results. The text should be in a simple language and understandable to externals. Short descriptions intended for wider audience should be included in the “work performed” and “results beyond the state of the art”. Another question is included on the “policy relevance” of the project to the policy objectives of the call. 7.3.5 Researchers The questionnaire on researchers involved in the project can be updated anytime in SyGMa when changes occur within the list of participating researchers. Additions should only be made for researchers as defined in the Frascati Manual and for researchers receiving their salary from other sources who are still contributing to the project’s activities. If a researcher does not participate or is removed (especially if their participation was considered very important at the time of the proposal), a justification must be given. Each partner will be responsible for updating the information on the EU’s platform as the project progresses, also informing the PMO of such changes. If these modifications also result in a change in Task Leaders, this PM Handbook will also be updated with the latest information, as well as all WP Leads being updated during the SC meetings.
