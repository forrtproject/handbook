We will foster a research culture of openness, integrity, and trustworthiness to advance reproducibility and knowledge. 2.1 Background Reproducibility is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that encompasses a continuum of practices related to the reproduction and replication of scientific results. iRISE takes an integrated approach to understanding, investigating and guiding strategies to address irreproducibility. 2.2 Objectives Our objectives are to: develop working definitions and a general framework for diagnosing and addressing reproducibility problems, define costs, benefits and opportunities, and assess the utility of theoretical evidence in forecasting the success of interventions (WP1), perform scoping and systematic reviews to identify and evaluate existing interventions to improve reproducibility (WP2), explore the interface between reproducibility and research culture, and in particular considerations and mainstreaming of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) (WP3), consult and engage key stakeholder groups in prioritising practices and practical tool development for adoption to increase reproducibility (WP4), test efficacy and feasibility of specific interventions to increase reproducibility (WP5), curate and integrate these different types of evidence to increase reproducibility for dissemination and implementation (WP6) and effectively project manage iRISE to achieve our objectives in a timely manner within budget (WP7). 2.3 Importance of effective project management iRISE involves multiple partners, disciplines and objectives. We need to coordinate and manage our interactions to ensure: We progress in a timely manner, meeting milestones and deliverables We facilitate effective communication and engagement within and outside the consortium Our work is rigorous, maintaining high-quality outputs and conduct We foster collaboration to enable us to work together smoothly despite geographical and disciplinary differences We promote accountability by clearly defining roles, responsibilities and tasks. This will include thorough documentation which is essential for reporting and future reference Project management is the backbone that will hold us together. It ensures that the diverse elements of the project work harmoniously toward achieving our objectives, maximising impact, and delivering outcomes on time and within budget. 2.4 Purpose and structure of this handbook This handbook provides practical insights and step-by-step guidance for the Project Management Office (PMO) and consortium members to ensure the successful execution of iRISE. All partners of the consortium should refer to this handbook throughout the duration of the project. The handbook is designed to align with EU regulations, guidelines, and best practices relevant to project management and is structured as follows: Project Overview Consortium Structure Communication and Reporting Data and File Management Reporting to the European Commission Deliverable Management and Quality Assurance Overview of Key Dates Intellectual Property and Dissemination Ethics and Compliance Appendices The content is intended to help members and the project adhere to EU requirements and maximise our chances of executing a successful project.

Our consortium management structure consists of the following key roles: Project Coordinators: iRISE is co-coordinated by Dr Sarah McCann (Charité) and Professor Emily Sena (UEDIN). McCann and Sena are responsible for overseeing the project as a whole, ensuring alignment with its objectives, maintaining quality, adhering to the project schedule, and managing the budget. Additionally, McCann, as the designated coordinator in the Grant Agreement, serves as the primary contact point for the European Commission. Supported by the Project Management Office (PMO), the BIH QUEST Center Office Administration Team, and the Research Grants Office at Charité, the co-coordinator’s main responsibilities are to: (1) ensure efficient project management; (2) guide the project’s decision-making process; (3) alternate chairing of the Steering Committee and lead the set of activities to be carried out by this committee; (4) coordinate technical/support activities across work-packages; (5) maintain and regularly update the contents of this project management handbook to support quality and timely delivery of iRISE deliverables; and (6) act as the Financial Officer within the Consortium, including managing the preparation of financial statements for the Commission. Project Manager (Rebecca Fischer, MIK): The Project Manager is responsible for the day-to-day coordination and administration of the project. She will ensure that the management procedures as defined below are carried out throughout the project’s lifetime and that supporting tools and templates will be made available. Management tasks include consolidation of the project planning, progress reports, milestone monitoring, financial management, etc. by gathering and aggregating inputs from the project partners. The project manager should be the first point of contact for project iRISE enquiries and will direct enquiries to the relevant persons or information sources. Project Management Office (PMO): The PMO, consists of the Co-coordinators (McCann and Sena) and the Project Manager (Fischer). The PMO will work collectively to successfully manage the project to meet our objectives, milestones and deliverables. They are responsible for financial management, modifications to the grant or consortium agreements and collecting information for the purposes of reporting to the European Commission. The PMO is also responsible for the organisation of project meetings, including ensuring work package and steering committee meetings are held, and the planning and chairing of the annual iRISE General Assembly. The PMO will meet at least monthly to ensure its effective performance. Steering Committee (SC): Comprising eight members, the iRISE SC includes each of the work package leads: McCann (Charité), Sena (UEDIN), Heyard (UZH), Fanelli (HW), Wever (RUMC), Marušić (MFEST), Miller (MIK) and Currie (UEDIN). The SC is responsible for the implementation of the project, quality management and is the highest decision-making body of the consortium. The main responsibilities of the SC include: (1) the definition of the overall project strategy; (2) fulfilling the Commission requirements pertaining to preparation of progress and financial reports; (3) deciding on long-term exploitation plans; (4) conflict resolution within the Consortium, in line with the details described in the iRISE Conflict Resolution Policy; (5) technical coordination and decision-making (assessment of the technical work, interchange of technical information amongst partners, submission of deliverables, etc.); and (6) risk management. The SC will meet quarterly, requires 2/3 majority for quorum, with decisions reached through a simple majority process. Work Package (WP) Leads: iRISE comprises seven WPs, each led by 1-2 individuals. The leads are: WP1 - Heyard (UZH), Fanelli (HW), WP2 and WP7 - McCann (Charité), Sena (UEDIN), WP3 - Miller (MIK), WP4 - Marušić (MFEST), WP5 - Wever (RUMC), and WP6 - Currie (UEDIN). WP leads are responsible for ensuring the delivery of their WP objectives. They are responsible for implementing and managing tasks and providing guidance and support to task leads as appropriate. They are responsible for ensuring regular, timely and effective communication between all members of the WP, including the organisation and chairing of WP meetings. They oversee the risk management for all tasks within the work package and are responsible for all technical aspects of their WP (meeting of milestones, timely submission of deliverables and reports, and the quality assurance of all WP outputs). WP leads also provide reports back to steering committee. Task Leaders: Work within WPs is divided into tasks with designated task leaders. Task leaders are responsible for the technical management of specific activities, including planning, monitoring and reporting to the WP leader. Each individual partner holds ultimate responsibility for the technical and administrative outputs assigned to them.

The SEAB provides strategic, ethical and scientific advice, offering valuable feedback on our progress to advance our aims. We will consult the SEAB on certain aspects of the project to ensure that what we are producing is fit for purpose and useful for the community. After each General Assembly, the co-coordinators meet with the SEAB for a more in-depth discussion of performance, ethical concerns, and further guidance. The SEAB acts in an advisory capacity without voting rights or decision-making power. Confirmed members of the SEAB are: Representing Name Organisation (country) Publisher Catriona MacCallum Wiley (UK) Funder James Morris Science Europe (Belgium) Infrastructure Provider Tim Errington Open Science Framework (USA) Research Network Antonia Schrader Reproducibility Networks in Europe Research Network Flavio Azevedo Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT) Researcher Kelly Cobey University of Ottawa (Canada) Stakeholder Forum (SF): We have established a SF that includes wide range of relevant stakeholders that includes: UK Reproducibility Network, Swiss Reproducibility Network, Slovak Reproducibility Network, German Reproducibility Network, Australian Reproducibility Network, Finnish Reproducibility Network, Italian Reproducibility Network, Norwegian Reproducibility Network, ReproducibiliTEA, RIOT Club, MetaMelb Research Group, David Moher (Centre for Journalology, Ottowa Hospital Research Institute), Thomas Steckler (Janssen), The Open Research Funders Group, Ensure Value in Research Group, Science Europe, Wiley, BMJ, Springer Nature, PLOS, Hindawi, University of Oxford, British Neuroscience Association, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, CERN, EATRIS, Centre for Open Science. Representatives from the Stakeholder Forum are invited to General Assemblies where we will facilitate dialogue for reflection on our approaches and outputs. The SF will help shape our actions to ensure workable/feasible/appropriate activities and this interaction will foster support from the wider community, as shown on Figure 1. Figure 1. Graphical depiction of the iRISE consortium management structure 4.1 Project Plan A well-structured project plan serves as a roadmap to achieve our objectives and milestones efficiently. This section provides guidance and descriptions on the iRISE project plan, including work package descriptions, tasks, milestones and timelines. The Description of Action (DoA) and iRISE Grant Agreement include this information in detail. Work Package Descriptions: Each work package (WP) is a critical component of the iRISE project. WP descriptions outline the purpose, scope, and tasks of each AP. Work package leaders and team members should use these descriptions as a reference for their responsibilities. Aligning work packages with the overall project objectives is essential. Task Plans: Tasks are the building blocks of work packages that describe the individual activities. Individuals are assigned responsibilities within tasks and clear timelines for each task are set considering dependencies between tasks and work packages. Milestone Definition: Milestones represent significant project achievements. They are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART). Milestones help track progress and ensure alignment with the project’s objectives. Budget Plan: Substantial time and consideration were given to budget planning for the successful execution of iRISE. The budget plan is detailed in the Grant Agreement. Eligible expenses and how to monitor and report on budget use are also detailed in the Grant Agreement and we encourage consultation with your European Research Office (or equivalent) to assist with ensuring partners keep within their allocated budget. Risk Management: It is critical that project risks are identified and managed, including a description of mitigation plans. Change Management: Over the lifetime of iRISE, things may evolve and require changes to the project plan. Anticipated changes must be communicated to the Project Management Office (PMO) as early as possible and must include details of the requested change with an evaluation of the impact of changes on project goals and timelines. Quality Assurance: Maintaining the quality of iRISE deliverables is essential throughout the project’s lifecycle. The strategy for quality control and quality assurance activities is described in further detail in the Deliverables section of this handbook. Collaboration and Communication: Effective communication and collaboration are essential for project success. Tools and platforms for sharing project information and strategies are described in detail in the Communication and Reporting section of this handbook. "],["communication-and-reporting.html", "5 Communication and Reporting 5.1 Internal communication 5.2 File Storage 5.3 Citation Management 5.4 External communication 5.5 Internal Reporting to Project Coordinator 5.6 Milestone Review Process", " 5 Communication and Reporting 5.1 Internal communication 5.1.1 Emails Day-to-day communication will be based on emails. All emails should include “iRISE” in the subject header and WP number where appropriate. An overview of available mailing lists and the complete lists can be accessed in the iRISE SharePoint in the mailing lists file. If a person needs to be added/removed from the list (or needs to be added to Microsoft Teams), then each partner should edit the respective list(s) in the mailing lists file. 5.1.2 Meetings WP meetings: To keep all WP members and project partners up-to-date and coordinate tasks, monthly meetings will be held for each WP. WP leaders will organize and chair the meeting with their WP members. During the first quarter of the project, WP leaders have defined that their monthly meetings will be held according to the information provided in the following table: WP Date/Time (e.g. First Tuesday of the month 10am CET) 1 First Friday of month 2:30pm CET (subject to change) 2 Every 14 days (on a Tuesday) 1:00pm CET 3 First Tuesday of a month, 10-11 am CET, intended to be changed to more frequent meetings once the WP starts 4 TBD once WP4 tasks begin 5 Every second Wednesday 10:00-11:00 CET, intended to be changed to monthly meetings after month 6 6 Scheduled monthly in response to doodle 7 Last Wednesday of the month – 10:30-11:30 CET SC Last Wednesday/Thursday of the month every Quarter – 10:30-12:00 CET SC meetings: The SC will meet every 3 months (every quarter). SC meetings will be organized and chaired by the PMO. Meetings will be virtual except for those that coincide General Assemblies that will take place in person. In the lead up to each SC meeting, WP leads will be asked to provide a plan for the next 6 months. This plan should include upcoming deliverables, task aims, timeline for each specific step, and areas of priority, integration with other WPs, TIER2 and OSIRIS as well as communication and publication strategy. During less intensive periods or when many partners are absent (e.g., summer), meetings might be held less frequently (e.g., every two months), depending on the project requirements and progress. During busy periods, they may be held more frequently (e.g., every two weeks or upon request). 5.1.3 Microsoft Teams All members should be included in the iRISE Microsoft Teams, which is hosted by Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. Individual members are tagged for the WPs in which they are included. The chat function may be used for communication, but important information must be shared via email. 5.2 File Storage The iRISE SharePoint that sits behind our Teams page, hosted by Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, will serve as a platform for storing, sharing and collaborating on documents. All documents must be stored in the corresponding WP section. To ensure version control and facilitate collaborative writing, file links should be used for sharing documents instead of downloaded versions. This will also reduce email traffic. Synchronizing the SharePoint to your computer eases access. 5.3 Citation Management Literature will be shared and managed on an iRISE Zotero Library. Folders can be created for each WP, task or publication as needed. All members have received the following instructions for joining the library: Install Zotero: https://www.zotero.org/download/ Instructions for using group libraries Zotero | Groups: https://www.zotero.org/groups/ Install the connector plugin for using Zotero in Microsoft Word and adding references from your browser: https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_integration https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/nmhdhpibnnopknkmonacoephklnflpho This allows adding references from your browser to the currently active Zotero library. 5.4 External communication iRISE communications will uphold the values of openness and integrity, and support reproducibility by committing to not sharing unsupported or misleading information. The iRISE Dissemination, Exploitation, and Communication Plan outlines preliminary strategies for effectively sharing all expected iRISE project outcomes and maximising their impact. All external communication activities (e.g. events, presentations, and publications) will be collected via the Dissemination Activity Record form, which all members of the Consortium are asked to fill in continuously. All created output will be available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence. Further detailed information is included in the Dissemination, Exploitation, and Communication Plan. 5.4.1 Funding Acknowledgement All iRISE communication materials as well as publications and other outputs must acknowledge EU support by displaying the European flag (emblem) and funding statement. Additionally, the following disclaimer must be included: “iRISE receives funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 101094853. Views and opinions expressed are however those of the author(s) only and do not necessarily reflect those of the European Union or the European Research Executive Agency (ERA). Neither the European Union nor the ERA can be held responsible for them. iRISE also receives funding from the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI): Direct Funding for Collaborative Projects as part of the transitional measures, and from UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). 5.4.2 Branding iRISE will maintain a consistent brand by using our logo, tagline, colour palette and fonts. Details of branding, including colours and fonts, can be found in the Dissemination, Exploitation, and Communication Plan. The iRISE logo (Figure 2) and its different formats and variants, including logos for each WP can be found in the Logos Folder. The logo should be included on all presentation and external communication materials. Figure 2: The iRISE logo and individual WP logos 5.4.3 Templates for Deliverables and Presentations All templates are available in the General/iRISE Dissemination_Communication_Templates folder. PowerPoint and Word Doc templates (including a PowerPoint Theme) that use the iRISE colour palette, logo and include the required acknowledgment wording are available for presentations and external communication. All presentations in which iRISE results are disseminated must use these branded files (hence, not with, for example, partner institution templates). Other templates may only be used for presentations in which majority of the content is not related to iRISE. Even in these cases, slides with iRISE results must include the logo, and the final slide must acknowledge funding for iRISE as described above. For Deliverables, a Deliverable Template is available. Deliverables should not deviate from the structure and style of the template. If any team creates a new item, for example a Poster, and there was no previous template, they will coordinate with WP6 to ensure communication is always conducted respecting the identity of the project. 5.4.4 Website and Social Media Platforms The project website is available at https://irise-project.eu/ and presents the project, the team and the SEAB. Additionally, it provides access to all project results and materials. At present, iRISE uses two social media platforms: 1. X (formerly Twitter), the handle for the project is @iRISE_EU 2. LinkedIn, which can be found here: https://www.linkedin.com/company/irise-eu/ The social media accounts are managed by WP6. All iRISE consortium members are encouraged to interact with iRISE posts to help boost their reach. Consortium members are also encouraged to create content that can be shared via our social media channels. Please contact Gillian Currie (gillian.currie@ed.ac.uk) with relevant content. 5.5 Internal Reporting to Project Coordinator In addition to obligatory reporting to the EC (see Reporting to the European Commission section), each WP will be asked to provide a work plan every 6 months, and each beneficiary will be asked to provide a financial report every 6 months to the coordinator. All members of the Consortium shall further continuously report any outreach activities at events (conferences, seminars, etc.) as well as publications and datasets related to the project via dedicated reporting forms, to facilitate periodic reporting about dissemination and communication activities. 5.5.1 6-Month WP Plans All partners will be asked to contribute to WP plans which will be put together at the beginning of each 6-month period, that will be presented at alternating SC meetings. Each WP leader is responsible for collecting contributions from all task leaders and uploading the work plan into the corresponding file on the Teams Environment within 2 weeks after the beginning of each new period (M6, M12, M18, M24, M30). WP leads will be sent a template for completing this information in advance. All WP plans describe the work plan for the following 6-month separately for each task in the WP, including upcoming deliverables, task aims, timeline for each specific step, areas of priority, integration with other WPs as well as communication and publication strategy. The communication strategy describes when and how awareness among the Consortium and external stakeholders will be raised. The publication strategy lists the publications planned for each task, including contributing authors and a preliminary abstract. Reports will further contain a section reporting on achieved results in the previous period, including milestones and deliverables, as well as deviations from the previous plan. 5.5.2 Financial Reporting every 6 Months Every 6 months, the controlling team at the coordinating institution will further send out an excel-sheet for reporting on financial resources. All partners are asked to report their use of resources in the respective tab of this document. 5.6 Milestone Review Process The Milestone Review Process in the iRISE project ensures that milestones are completed and reviewed on time. The lead author, usually the task lead, is responsible for storing milestone reports in the appropriate Microsoft Teams/ SharePoint folder and notifying the Consortium via email by the deadline. For milestones not documented by meeting minutes, a designated reviewer from the Consortium, who is not heavily involved in the milestone’s creation, reviews the work. This reviewer provides comments or suggested changes using the track changes feature. The lead author must then address these comments promptly to finalise the milestone. The timeline for the review process is outlined in Table 1, with specific reviewer assignments detailed in Table 2. Table 1, which outlines the review process in relation to the due date of each milestone. This due date is always the last day of the month as specified in the Description of Action. Consortium-wide meeting minutes, which serve as evidence for certain milestones, are circulated to the entire Consortium, following the procedures outlined in the Grant Agreement. This ensures that all members are kept informed and that the process remains transparent. If a reviewer is no longer part of the project, their partner institution must reassign the task and propose the new reviewer to the project co-coordinators for approval. This structured process ensures that all milestones are reviewed thoroughly and completed on schedule, supporting the overall progress of the project.

To ensure version control and facilitate collaborative writing, file links should be used for sharing documents instead of downloaded versions. Synchronizing the SharePoint to your computer eases access. 6.2 Data management plan The first version of the DMP will be published through DMP online before month 6 [link to follow]. An internal version of the DMP will be deposited on iRISE Microsoft Teams in the section for WP 6. The DMP is populated with the task-specific information collected in the DMP table on the iRISE teams. The plan will be regularly updated. Every six months (starting in September 2024), the core DMP team (Heyard and Currie) will meet with relevant iRISE partners to decide whether updates to the DMP are required. Prior to this meeting, task leads will be sent a survey to collect information on whether the management plan for the data outputs they are responsible for has changed. All task leads must fill in the survey, even if nothing has changed. WP leads are requested to contact the DMP core team via email if major updates to the DMP are required (before the next scheduled meeting). 6.3 Minimal metadata standards All data outputs will be complemented with metadata, as outlined in the DMP. The following elements are required: Title: title describing the data output at hand. Principal Investigator or Creator: the main person(s) responsible for the intellectual content, with affiliation(s). Contributor(s): any other person(s) who contributed to the data output with affiliation(s). Funding: funding source of the project leading to the data output (iRISE and additional funding sources must be acknowledged here). References and citations: Citations to relevant work or other objects/material leading to the data output or using the data output. Only cite those articles or material that are important for the data output to be reusable and interpretable.

They cover the following project periods: Period 1: M1-M18 = 1 September 2023 – 28 February 2025 Period 2: M19-M36 = 1 March 2025 – 28 August 2026 The periodic reports will be submitted by the coordinator within 60 days of the end of each reporting period, which is in M18 and M36 respectively. General reporting principles will be as follows: The Project Coordinator will request WP leaders to report on their WP using a generic reporting template provided by the Project Coordinator; WP leaders will prepare inputs for the periodic report by collecting inputs from their WP task leaders; The Project Coordinator will combine all this information into a coherent periodic report. All partners will then review this report. The Project Coordinator will then revise appropriately and submit to the EC by the required date. Please note that all partners must keep time records of the hours worked on the action, in accordance with Article 20.1(e) of the Grant Agreement. 7.1 Periodic Technical Reporting The periodic technical reports cover the work conducted by the project partners between M1 and M18, and M19 and M36. The periodic reports will follow the official template and will contain the following parts: Part A: Is created by the participant portal’s IT system based on information entered by participants. Summary for publication Summary of the context and overall objectives of the project Work performed from the beginning of the project to the end of the period covered by the report including main results achieved so far Progress beyond the state of the art and expected potential impact Overview of researchers involved in the project Deliverables Milestones Critical Risks Project Pathway to Impact Results Ownership List Publications Datasets Intellectual property rights Standards Other results Dissemination and communication activities Impact Research Infrastructure Part B: Part B will be compiled in a Word document within the Teams environment, based on inputs provided by the WP leads and then submitted as one comprehensive report by the coordinator. Explanation of the work carried out by the beneficiaries and overview of the progress Objectives of the project Explanation of the work carried out in each WP Impact Follow-up of recommendations and comments from previous review(s) (if applicable) Open Science Deviations from Description of Action (Annex 1 &amp; 2) (if applicable) 7.2 Periodic Financial Reporting Financial statements cover each partner’s cost claim for the previous reporting period. They will be submitted to the European Commission electronically via the participant portal. An individual financial statement (Annex 4 of the GA) from each beneficiary will provide an explanation of the use of resources and the information on subcontracting and in-kind contributions provided by third parties from each beneficiary for the reporting period concerned. Before submission, the financial statement must be signed by the financial signatory at each partner institution (FSIGN). The request for interim payment will be also submitted together with the financial statement. If a partner does not submit their financial reporting on time, no interim payment to the respective partner will be made during this period. The individual financial statement must detail the eligible costs (outlined under Article 6 of the GA) for each budget category (see Annex 2). Eligible costs include: direct personnel costs; direct costs of subcontracting; direct costs of providing financial support to third parties; other direct costs (travel costs, equipment, other goods and services); indirect costs (flat rate 25%) All records and supporting documents of costs must be kept as proofs (see article 20 of the GA). Further information related to financial management can be found in the EC Online Manual. To ensure smooth and accurate financial reporting, iRISE will undertake a “dry run” of the financial reporting exercise in Month 6 – February 2024. 7.3 Continuous Reporting Continuous Reporting is available from the beginning of the project and can be edited by all beneficiaries in SyGMa (System for Grant Management). A snapshot of the data entered within the tabs for continuous reporting will also be included in the periodic reports when submitted. More information on continuous reporting can be found here. 7.3.1 Reporting on Impact Different SyGMa tabs (Impact, Impact continuation, Beneficiaries feedback) include questionnaires to monitor and evaluate the Horizon Europe programme performance. There, progress of the impact is recorded. Impact questionnaire: collects information about technology readiness, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and citizen engagement Impact continuation questionnaire: records information about scientific, societal, environmental and economic impacts of project implementation Beneficiaries feedback questionnaire asks about key factors fostering and impeding the impact of the progress of the project 7.3.2 Reporting on Communication, Dissemination and Exploitation Reporting on communication, dissemination and exploitation follows a qualitative rather than a quantitative approach. Two separate tabs exist in SyGMa on communication and dissemination activities. The main communication and dissemination activities should be added to these tabs, especially when costs were charged to the project. Activities should be described including their purpose, the target audience and their status. It is critical the iRISE consortium members regularly enter details into the Dissemination Activity Record to facilitate this reporting. Entries can be removed from SyGMa if they have not been included in a periodic report and edited if they have not been included in an intermediate report. The final periodic report must include at least one communication and one dissemination activity with the status “delivered” and no activities with the stats “ongoing” or “postponed”. 7.3.3 Reporting on Project Results Continuous reporting on project results is also required, focusing on content. The according tabs in SyGMa are called “Results” and “Other Results”. Name and type of results is to be recorded, if they are Key Exploitable Results, audience or target groups and steps undertaken towards exploitation and market maturity. 7.3.4 Project Summary The project summary is automatically published in CORDIS with the proposal abstract already filled in. It should be continuously updated when the project produces results. The text should be in a simple language and understandable to externals. Short descriptions intended for wider audience should be included in the “work performed” and “results beyond the state of the art”. Another question is included on the “policy relevance” of the project to the policy objectives of the call. 7.3.5 Researchers The questionnaire on researchers involved in the project can be updated anytime in SyGMa when changes occur within the list of participating researchers. Additions should only be made for researchers as defined in the Frascati Manual and for researchers receiving their salary from other sources who are still contributing to the project’s activities. If a researcher does not participate or is removed (especially if their participation was considered very important at the time of the proposal), a justification must be given. Each partner will be responsible for updating the information on the EU’s platform as the project progresses, also informing the PMO of such changes. If these modifications also result in a change in Task Leaders, this PM Handbook will also be updated with the latest information, as well as all WP Leads being updated during the SC meetings.

A subfolder has been created for each deliverable (named [Dx.y_max3words_deliverable_name]). All PUBLIC deliverables in iRISE will automatically be published in CORDIS following submission. This should be kept in mind when preparing deliverables for submission. 8.1 Deliverable Document Structure and Style Deliverables must use the Deliverable Template. Its style (including fonts, colours, headers/footers, numbering of headings) and structure must be maintained. The following general structure should be followed and is as such provided in the deliverable template of the project: Cover page (project title, title of deliverable, date, lead beneficiary, authors, reviewers) Document Information and Revision History (information table, revision history table) Table of Contents Executive Summary List of Abbreviations Core part Acknowledgements References Annexes (optional) 8.2 Internal Review Process and Deadlines for Deliverables The lead author (task lead) is responsible for submitting the deliverable by ensuring the latest version is stored within the respective folder in Microsoft Teams/SharePoint and informing the Consortium via email within the deadline (as described below). All deliverables will be reviewed internally in the Consortium. Content/research deliverables will be reviewed by two project partners not or only marginally involved in the creation of the deliverable. Reviewers must ensure that all content is consistent with the provided summary, the objectives of the deliverable, are scientifically correct and of high quality. In addition, the reviewers should also perform proof-reading and grammar checks. The reviewer must provide comments or modifications using the track changes features. The assigned reviewers and deadlines for all deliverables are detailed in Table 2. The iRISE PM Planner also details the deadlines and responsible individuals for each deliverable and milestone. The lead author and their partner institution are then responsible for ensuring that all reviewer comments are addressed in a timely fashion to ensure submission to the EC by the official delivery date. All deliverables will be uploaded to the EC Participant Portal by Sarah McCann. Hence, lead authors should ensure that the final deliverable is stored within the dedicated Microsoft Teams folder and inform the coordinating partner at least two days in advance of the final submission date. Table 1 presents the timeline for the deliverable review process in terms of weeks and days before the due date. The due date always corresponds to the last date of the month number indicated in the Description of Action. Meanwhile Table 2 presents the responsible reviewer and partner institution for each Deliverable. As with the case of a change in researchers participating in the project, if any of the identified reviewers ceases to participate in iRISE, the partner institution is responsible for re-assigning a reviewer within their structure and propose the change to the project co-coordinators, who will either approve the change or assign the review to another iRISE member whose knowledge is adequate for the task at hand.

Additionally, we define our target audiences and how the messages will reach them. We will also describe how we will monitor engagement with iRISE outputs and the effectiveness of our dissemination, exploitation and communication activities. As part of the strategies for disseminating iRISE project results, publications, and public engagement activities, we have developed guidelines and principles for the publication of research outcomes generated within iRISE. The latest version of our publication policy can be found here: Publication policy. The publication policy aims to ensure transparency, fairness, and proper acknowledgment of contributions while upholding the highest standards of research integrity and publication ethics.

"],["ethics-and-compliance.html", "11 Ethics and Compliance 11.1 Responsible research practice 11.2 Compliance with Horizon Europe ethical standards 11.3 Artificial Intelligence 11.4 Conflict resolution policy 11.5 Risk Management", " 11 Ethics and Compliance Based on self-assessment (included in Annex 1) and the initial structure of the Project, four main types of ethical considerations have been identified in iRISE: Human Data Protection Scientific Research Artificial intelligence Our Project involves the participation of researchers, workers, employees, and other stakeholders, including the collection of their personal data. Considering the Project’s internal stakeholders, i.e., individuals who are affiliated with any of the project’s partners, it is assumed that their participation in all of the projects’ activities follows the principles of fair distribution of benefits and burdens, the respect for people and human dignity, their rights and personal interests, as well as their free, informed consent to partake in the Project. Moreover, iRISE involves individuals who are not part of the participants’ staff (beneficiaries, affiliated entities, associated partners, subcontractors, etc.). Participation in this Project will be entirely voluntary. External participants’ informed consent will be obtained, and advised on how any data they provide will be treated. The treatment of the latter is dealt with in detail in the Data Management Plan (DMP). The EU Ethics and data protection decision tree were implemented to identify ethics issues, together with the Horizon Europe Programme Guide V.3.01, specifically the Ethics and Integrity section. The primary sources of EU and international law are directly linked to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). This also includes its protocols and other texts, which are included in the reference section and directly relate to: EU Charter of Fundamental Rights European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and its Supplementary Protocols. European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity of ALLEA (All European Academies) EU Regulation 2016/679 Protection of natural persons concerning the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Swiss New Federal Act on Data Protection, in alignment with the EU’s GDPR UK Equality Act UK Human Rights Act UK Consumer Rights legislation UK data protection laws The EU rules for data protection and safeguarding ethical principles have been consulted and respected, including fundamental ethical principles. Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights2 stipulates that everyone in the EU has the right to the protection of personal data concerning themselves, access to data which has been collected concerning them, and the right to rectify it. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) expands this, stipulating the right to erasure. All relevant national, EU and international legislation was consulted during the elaboration of the DMP as well as this document. No research in this Project will involve Human Embryonic Stem Cells, Human embryos or human foetal tissues/cells, animals, plants, or other biological entities tampering with or modifying the environment. Furthermore, at the release of this ethics requirements document, no Artificial Intelligence usage was identified neither as a core part of the development of any task within the Project nor as a tool implemented within any of the partner institution’s SOPs. Therefore, it was not considered as an ethical issue. Lastly, scientific research was the third type of potential risk linked to ethical issues. In this context, adequately gathering data, implementing the most suitable methodological approach, providing detailed and trustworthy results, as well as not incurring any plagiarism, subcontracting, or non-ethical approaches are at the core of iRISE’s commitment to upholding high ethical research standards by adhering to the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (ECCRI). 11.1 Responsible research practice iRISE commits to the highest ethical standards and to follow the ALLEA European Code of Conduct for research integrity. Responsibility for adhering to these principles lies primarily with the WP leads. In addition, the Project Coordinator and Project Manager will monitor adherence based on the reporting provided during SC meetings. 11.2 Compliance with Horizon Europe ethical standards iRISE is carried out in line with the highest ethical standards and the applicable EU, international and national law on ethical principles. Consortium members commit to and ensure the respect of basic EU values (such as respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights, including the rights of minorities). The Consortium and the project coordinator have long-standing experience in managing and working in the context of the EU Research and Innovation Framework Programs and other EU projects engaging different stakeholders and communities. All beneficiaries of iRISE have been made aware of the ethical principles adopted during the project activities, have participated in the compilation and drafting of this document, and commit to following policies and procedures, as well as complying with the obligations herein disclosed. The Consortium ensures compliance with applicable international, EU and national laws of the iRISE involved partners. It includes the ethical regulations that the EU applies to funded projects, the general ethical recommendations in force in EU countries and the laws applied to sectors that have implicit ethical problems. The beneficiaries must act in compliance with ethical principles (including the highest standards of research integrity) and - applicable EU, international and national law as stated in the above sections of this document. No funding can be granted for prohibited activities in all Member States within or outside the EU. No funding can be granted in a Member State for an activity forbidden in that Member State. The beneficiaries must pay particular attention to the principle of proportionality, the right to privacy, the right to the protection of personal data, the right to the physical and mental integrity of persons, the right to non-discrimination, the need to ensure the protection of the environment and high levels of human health protection3. The beneficiaries must ensure that the activities under the action focus exclusively on civil applications. Additionally, the Project will be carried out with minimal environmental impact, in alignment with the EU’s objectives for 2050, including but not limited to the EU Green Deal and the EU Taxonomy4. In this context, printing will be limited to the essential elements, always using certified paper (i.e., Forest Stewarship Council). Employees working on iRISE-related tasks or WPs will be able to carry out their tasks, wherever possible and in accordance with the partner institutions’ internal Human Resources policies in a flexible work-from-home schedule, thus reducing CO2 emissions and limiting negative environmental impact. Following the Furthermore, travelling will be limited to the agreements established within the Grant Agreement (GA) to ensure proper deployment of the Project’s activities while limiting the negative environmental impact of these actions. 11.3 Artificial Intelligence The iRISE consortium will be using artificial intelligence as one of the tools that will support the various tasks, activities and WP milestones and deliverables. To ensure adequate compliance and limiting any potential ethical risks, the AI specific Ethics and Compliance, as well as Data Management Policy using this tool will be detailed in the iRISE Data Management Plan. In this document, details of the scope and usage of AI will be determined, related risks will be identified, and a detailed guide on risk management and ethical risk mitigation will be provided. Any issues addressing ethical concerns and AI were identified in the self-assessment included in Annex 1 of this document. 11.4 Conflict resolution policy The iRISE consortium agrees on a fair and transparent framework for addressing conflicts that may arise within the project. The conflict resolution policy aims to ensure effective and respectful resolution processes, promoting a harmonious and collaborative environment among consortium members. The current version can be found here: iRISE_Conflict_Resolution_Policy_2023-09-07_draft_v1.docx 11.5 Risk Management The consortium members have pre-identified risks and developed preliminary mitigation strategies for each WP, which can be found in the Risk Assessment folder. WP leads, in collaboration with task leads, will be required to undertake a formal risk assessment every six months that is presented at alternating SC meeting. Potential issues, contingencies and mitigation strategies must be assessed and described for each task. The potential source of the risk should also be considered (i.e technical, financial, operational, and external factors). Risk assessments should be presented in a Risk Matrix, that includes description of the potential impact of identified risks on project objectives and the probability of each risk occurring. It is important that insights from risk management are used to improve future activities and execution, and there is ongoing learning from risk events. Further information on risk management strategies can also be found in the Data Management Plan.
