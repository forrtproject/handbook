# **Communication and Reporting**

Effective communication is essential for coordination across FORRT’s many volunteer-led and collaborative projects. This chapter outlines how internal and external communication should be structured to promote transparency, responsiveness, and shared ownership.

## Internal Communication

### Slack

Slack is FORRT’s primary platform for internal communication. Every contributor is expected to join our Slack workspace and participate in the appropriate team channels (e.g., #team-glossary, #team-lesson-plans).

**Best Practices:**
- Use public channels for most project discussions to ensure transparency and allow others to learn or contribute.
- Threads should be used for replies to keep conversations organized.
- Use channel-specific tags or emojis to signal updates or tasks.
- Pin important documents or decisions to the channel for easy reference.

New members receive an invite during onboarding. [INSERT LINK OR CONTACT FOR SLACK INVITE]

### Email

Email may still be used for more formal communication (e.g., external collaborators, contracts, or institutional outreach). FORRT does not use internal mailing lists. If email is necessary, use clear subject lines (e.g., “FORRT – [Team/Project]: Topic”) and include relevant Slack or document links.

[OPEN QUESTION: Should core FORRT coordinators use a shared inbox or alias for external outreach?]

### Shared Documents

Project documents, meeting notes, and deliverables are stored in cloud-based platforms (typically Google Drive or OSF). Each team is responsible for maintaining its folder and updating links in relevant Slack channels or documents.

**Best Practices:**
- Name documents and folders clearly (e.g., “Glossary_Draft_v1_2025-03-01”).
- Use shared drives where possible instead of personal storage.
- Avoid duplicate versions; link directly to editable files in Slack or documentation.

## Meetings

### Team Meetings

Each team is encouraged to meet at least monthly to:
- Review progress on ongoing tasks
- Assign roles and support contributors
- Identify blockers and request help if needed

Meeting notes should be stored in a shared team folder and shared (or summarized) in the relevant Slack channel. A template for meeting notes is available here: [INSERT LINK TO TEMPLATE]

### Leadership and Steering Council Meetings

The FORRT Steering Council meets quarterly to:
- Review ongoing work across teams
- Discuss cross-team coordination
- Set shared priorities and timelines
- Review feedback and potential structural improvements

Team leads may be asked to submit brief updates ahead of these meetings.

### Community-Wide Events

Occasional community-wide events (e.g., onboarding calls, open idea workshops, open office hours) are coordinated by the Operations Coordinator or relevant project leads and announced via Slack.

## External Communication

External communication is aligned with FORRT’s values of openness, accuracy, inclusivity, and clarity.

### Public Announcements

All public-facing content (e.g., project launches, calls for participation, published outputs) should:
- Use consistent branding and naming conventions
- Credit contributors appropriately
- Include links to source documents and licenses (e.g., CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)

External announcements are usually coordinated by the Outreach Team or project-specific leads. Shared templates and logos can be found here: [INSERT LINK TO BRANDING KIT]

### Social Media and Outreach

FORRT uses social media (e.g., Twitter, Mastodon, LinkedIn) to:
- Share new outputs and events
- Amplify related work from partners and contributors
- Showcase community highlights

The Outreach Team manages main accounts. Team leads may coordinate with them for joint announcements or event promotion.

## Reporting

### Project Updates

Each team or project is expected to provide periodic updates in the #project-updates Slack channel. This helps the broader community stay informed and allows cross-pollination of ideas.

Recommended frequency: once every 4–6 weeks or before major milestones.

### Leadership Updates

Before each Steering Council meeting, team leads are asked to submit a short written update, including:
- Progress highlights
- Any blockers or support needs
- Planned next steps
- New contributors or changes in leadership

A shared template is available to streamline these updates. [INSERT LINK TO TEMPLATE]

### Transparency and Accountability

All major decisions, deliverables, and documents should be documented in shared team folders or publicly accessible repositories when appropriate. FORRT emphasizes constructive feedback, openness to iteration, and shared ownership of outcomes.
