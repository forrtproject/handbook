# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Vision and Mission

FORRT envisions a research and educational culture defined by openness, integrity, inclusivity, and trust. Our mission is to empower educators and learners worldwide by integrating open and reproducible practices into research training. Through community‐driven pedagogical reform, we aim to advance research transparency, reproducibility, rigor, and ethics in a manner that is accessible and equitable to all.

## Background

In recent years, the importance of open and reproducible practices in research has become increasingly clear. While many initiatives focus on research integrity, far fewer address the essential role of education in embedding these practices into daily academic work. FORRT was established as a grassroots, volunteer‐driven community dedicated to transforming science education by integrating open scholarship into teaching and mentoring. Our approach emphasizes practical engagement, collaborative resource development, and the promotion of scholarly openness as a social justice imperative.

*Note: This handbook was developed in response to the evolving landscape of open science education and is designed to serve both internal project leads and external collaborators. It is built on the [iRise project management handbook](https://camaradesuk.github.io/irise_pm_handbook/), for which we are very grateful.*

## Objectives

The primary objectives of FORRT are to:

1. **Develop a Shared Framework:** Establish clear definitions and guidelines for integrating open science practices into educational settings.
2. **Curate High-Quality Resources:** Assemble and evaluate pedagogical tools (e.g., lesson plans, summaries, glossaries) that support open and reproducible research training.
3. **Embed Diversity and Inclusivity:** Ensure that our initiatives actively promote equity and provide opportunities for underrepresented groups.
4. **Engage the Community:** Involve educators, students, and stakeholders in a collaborative process to co-create and continuously refine our tools and practices.
5. **Pilot and Implement Initiatives:** Launch programs such as mentorship schemes, open office hours, and collaborative workshops that demonstrate the practical benefits of open scholarship.
6. **Disseminate Openly:** Share our resources and outcomes through open-access platforms and strategic partnerships to contribute to the global conversation on open science.

## Project Management Philosophy

Effective project management in FORRT is not defined by strict timelines or budgets alone—it is the cohesive force that unites our community and ensures that our collective efforts remain aligned with our mission. Our approach prioritizes flexibility, proactive communication, and continuous improvement. By fostering an environment where ideas are freely shared and every contribution is recognized, we empower volunteers to bring their unique strengths to our projects.

## Terminology and Audience

In this handbook, traditional consortium terminology has been replaced with language that reflects our community-driven model. All team members—whether internal project leads or external collaborators—are integral parts of the FORRT community. This document is designed to guide everyone in managing projects efficiently while upholding FORRT’s core values.

## Handbook Purpose

This handbook is a living document that provides practical guidance on managing FORRT projects. It outlines procedures, best practices, and strategic approaches to ensure that all initiatives remain aligned with our mission and values. The handbook serves as a resource for:

- **Internal Project Leads:** To streamline planning, coordination, and quality assurance across our diverse teams.
- **External Collaborators:** To understand our approach, engage effectively with our community, and contribute to our shared objectives.
